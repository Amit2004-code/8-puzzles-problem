The 8-Puzzle Problem involves solving a sliding puzzle where the goal is to rearrange tiles in a 3x3 grid to match a predefined 
configuration. The Manhattan Distance heuristic, an admissible heuristic function, was employed to optimize the search for the 
solution using the A* algorithm.

The Manhattan Distance calculates the total distance each tile needs to move to reach its goal position. The distance for a tile is calculated as:

Manhattan Distance
The Manhattan Distance calculates the total distance each tile needs to move to reach its goal position. 

Manhattan Distance= ∣x1−x2∣+∣y1−y2∣
where x1 and y1 is the current position of the tile.
      x2 and y2 is the goal position of the tile.

This heuristic is admissible because it never overestimates the true cost to the goal.

The solution is both optimal and computationally feasible for the 3x3 grid size. Results are output in a clear and traceable 
format for validation and analysis
